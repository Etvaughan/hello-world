# hello-world
This is where it begins

This seems oddly biographical, and probably outside the scope of this exercise's purpose, but I suppose this is where I can get a few things off my chest. This is me finally committing. Going after this now is my number one priority. I admit in the past to thinking that this would be easy, and brushing it off as something I could pick up whenever I felt like it. I know now that that's not the case. It's gonna be hard. I suppose we all start somewhere.
